# Identifying and Disaggregating Expenditure Patterns in Urban Pakistan: An exercise in Data synthesis



This public repository contains code and maps for the reaserch paper titled `Identifying and Disaggregating Expenditure Patterns in Urban Pakistan: An exercise in Data synthesis`. The paper provides a novel method to calculate expenditure at a fine geospatial scale in Urban Pakistan, by synthesizing and transforming several different open source data, and passing them through a statistical pipeline specially designed for this task that generates powerful conclusions from relatively sparse data.
